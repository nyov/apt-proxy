.SH "Name"
apt\-proxy \- A proxy for saving bandwidth to Debian servers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B apt\-proxy
.I "[options] [logfile]"
.br
.PP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBapt\-proxy\fP is a python program designed to be run as an stand alone
server via twistd, and provides a clean, caching, intelligent proxy for
\fBapt\-get\fP, which speaks HTTP to apt\-get clients, and http or ftp to
the back-end server(s)\&.  Usually it is run on port 9999, mainly because
that is the default configuration, and people are lazy\&.
.PP
.SH "CLIENT CONFIGURATION"
Once \fBapt\-proxy\fP is configured, users then edit their
\fBsources\&.list\fP file to point to the proxy (which uses the http
protocol to serve clients), like so:

.nf
deb http://SERVER:9999/main woody main contrib non\-free
deb http://SERVER:9999/non\-US woody/non\-US main contrib non\-free
deb\-src http://SERVER:9999/main woody main contrib non\-free
deb\-src http://SERVER:9999/non\-US woody/non\-US main contrib non\-free

deb http://SERVER:9999/helixcode/ woody main
.fi

What path should be specified after the server name and port number
depends on the configuration of \fBapt\-proxy\fP (which can restrict
paths and send different paths to different servers)\&.  In this
example, non\-US/ and helixcode/ actually retrieve files from different
back-end servers\&.

Note that you can also use the nicknames `unstable', `frozen' etc, but
Packages/Sources files may get duplicated, so it is advised use either the
symbolic or the code name and stick with it.
.PP
.SH "SERVER CONFIGURATION"
See
.BR apt\-proxy.conf (8)
for details of how to set up apt\-proxy to use backends near to you.
.PP
.SH "CARE AND FEEDING OF MIRRORS"

\fBapt\-proxy\fP reduces the bandwidth requirements of Debian mirrors
by  restricting the frequency of Packages, Releases and Sources file updates
from the back end and only doing a single fetch for any file, how ever many
users request it from the proxy.

.SH "BUGS"
Packages are not compressed using gzip \-\-rsyncable, which gives a 30%
reduction in bytes transferred for binary packages, and much greater for
source and other packages.

NOTE: v2 doesn't officially support rsync backends, so for now the above does
not apply.
