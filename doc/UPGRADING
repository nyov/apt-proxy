UPGRADING FROM <= 1.9.5
-----------------------

	The following files may be left over when you upgrade from
	apt-proxy-v2 package. And since apt-proxy-v2 was never uploaded to
	Debian mirrors I won't bother with it.

	I understand that if you were brave enough to install such an
	experimental package you are brave enough to take care of the left
	overs.

		/etc/init.d/apt-proxy-v2
		/etc/default/apt-proxy-v2
		/var/log/apt-proxy-v2.log*
 
UPGRADING FROM 1.3.x to 1.9.x
-----------------------------

	You should be able to upgrade/downgrade between 1.3.x and 1.9.x
	without much trouble.

	If you don't have /etc/apt-proxy/apt-proxy-v2.conf when upgrading from
	1.3.x to 1.9.x, the postinst will provide one for you based on your
	current /etc/apt-proxy/apt-proxy.conf using apt-proxy-v1tov2(8)
	script. 

	IMPROVEMENTS
	------------
	
	- Much better performance.
	
	- Code much easier to maintain.

	- More reliable.
		- Well, it is still young and wider testing may reveal
		  problems.

	REGRESIONS
	----------

	- There is no statistics gathering
		If there is interest I'll try, but there are more important
		things.
	
	- multiple server backends are not implemented.
		After releasing current code, and having it a little exercised
		this will bump to the top of the TODO list.
		¿Should I keep apt-proxy v2 in experimental until this is done?

	- 'max_age' and 'CLEANUP_DAYS' don't quite mean the same, 'max_age'
	  doesn't take into acount if there is a newer version of the package

	- rsync is not officially supported.
		It can work with rsync and some LD_PRELOAD hack, although it
		has not been tested for a while, and the shared library is not
		included in the .deb package.
		If someone convinces me that it is still usefull in the
		current situation I may give another chance to rsync backends.

	- '+' prefix or equivalent functionality is not supported.
		This was specially usefull for rsyncing uncompressed Packages
		files, which are not anymore available.

		'rsyncpackages' config option was supposed to fill the gap,
		but in the current situation, someone will have to convince me
		that it is still usefull.

	CHANGES
	-------

	- 'cleanup_freq' and 'CLEAN_SWEEP' don't quite mean the same, v2 does
	  more on cleanup than just erase old files.
		- delete files that have not been accessed in max_age
		- scan cache directories and update internal tables
		- ...

	- backend names can not contain '/' and directory names within the
	  cache are automaticaly named after the backend name.
		1.3.x allowed you to give a different name to the backend and
		the directory to store the files on the cache. If you used
		that "feature" apt-proxy 1.9.x will not find previously cached
		files for the affected backend unless you rename the directory
		on the cache.

	  	NOTE: apt-proxy-v1tov2 should complain about this.
