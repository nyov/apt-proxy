Mirror house-keeping:support apt-proxy-import operations again (DONE?)
	Consider using a little heuristic for unknown versions.
		Look for all versions of the package on the listings and move
		it to the path of the version just on top of it.

Mirror house-keeping:MAX_VERSIONS (DONE?)
	version numbers are not properly taken into account
	keep track of versions per distro (potato/woody/sid)
		python-apt should help on that

---------------- "Not so urgent" mark ---------------------------
Take care of python-apt memory leak:
	deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ sid main non-free contrib
		1200 iterations (load, unload)
		leak 528KB (3676-4204) in increments of 36 kB
		0.44KB per iteration.
	deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ sid contrib
		2300 iterations (load, unload)
		leak 360KB (3676-4036) in increments of 36 kB
		0.15KB per iteration.

If we overwrite a cached file while it is being read by an static.FileTransfer
things may go wrong.
	Maybe we should write an AptProxyClientFile so it can be added to
	factory.runningClients to prevent that.

Cleanup orphan entries in packages.db also

Implement HEAD method

Parse options:
	--conf
	...

per backend 'min_age'
	we won't bother to update a Packages file before it is "min_age" old

Multi server backends.

rsync only Packages files, for the rest only ftp and http
	updating a corrupt .deb is probably rare enough not to be worth it.

Consider "Pargma: no-cache" and "Cache-Control: no-cache" to make the client
	do "verify_file" and tell us that the file is corrupt

try to use libapt's backend clients

generate a config file from sources.list

Is process.Process a producer? 

Mirror house-keeping:Generate Packages/Release/... for the currently available
	stuff
	
auto generate a sample sources.list for clients

autogenerate backend configuration using netselect-apt or similar

Consider implementing rproxy
	- for cascading apt-proxy.
	- to access mirrors which may have it.
	- sincronizing two caches

Consider using apt-build to get "auto recompiled for your processor" packages.

---------------- OLD LIST from v1 ---------------------------
TODO list for apt-proxy

- Return a better error message if the backend servers do not exist, rather
  than 'directory does not exist'

- Make it more clear that apt-proxy should not be configured as an http proxy,
  but as an http server, or support using apt-proxy as a proxy...

- Add debconf questions for default user and cache directory

- Add more possible servers to default config file.  I would be grateful if
  people who are using alternative servers would file a wishlist bug containing
  their apt-proxy.conf, and I'll integrate it into the distribution.

- Work through the remaining wishlist bugs in the BTS.  Keep those reports
  coming in folks!
