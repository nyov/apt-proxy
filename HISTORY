1.2.0:
	Gerhard Muntingh:
	  - Add logfile and configfile command line options
	Chris Halls:
	  - Integrate debian packaging directory into source
	  - Revert to using dd while streaming because tail does not
	    return an error when the file is moved away from under it.  Fixes
	    the most common file corruption problems while streaming
	  - Check for corrupted .deb and .gz files in the cache before sending
	    them to the client.
	  - Use the package filelists logic from Martin Schwenke to send the
	    size of package files before downloading, meaning connection
	    keep-alive logic can be used.
1.1.4:
	Martin Schwenke:
	  - Add MAX_VERIONS to limit the number of versions of a particular
	    package to keep.
	  - Fix bug in cleanup that caused files from other packages to be deleted
1.1.3:
        Stephen Rothwell:
   	  - Use stat and tail if available instead of wc -c and dd 
	  - Honour client keep-alive header
1.1.0:
	Added keep-alive support: large speedup.
	Added `+' prefix for preferred backends for control files.
	Suppress spurious messages in logs.
	Fix streaming.
	Cache misses on Release files.
	Deal with streaming out of binary-all/ (SIZE found correctly).
	Avoid runaway apt-proxy processes.
	Added KEEP_STATS option and copy potentially similar files.
