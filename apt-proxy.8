.SH "Name"
apt-proxy \- A proxy for saving bandwidth to Debian servers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B apt-proxy
.I "[options] [logfile]"
.br
.PP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBapt-proxy\fP is an advanced shell script designed to be run out of
inetd, and provides a clean, caching, intelligent proxy for
\fBapt-get\fP, which speaks HTTP to apt-get clients, and rsync to the
back-end server(s)\&.  Usually it is run on port 9999, mainly because
that is the default configuration, and people are lazy\&.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
apt-proxy's command options are as follows:
.TP
.B -l <logfile>
Specify the file to log to, defaults to /var/log/apt-proxy.
The logfile can also be specified as the first (non-option) parameter
on the command line.
.TP
.B -c <configfile>
Specify what file the config is stored in, defaults to
/etc/apt-proxy.conf .
.br
.SH "CLIENT CONFIGURATION"
Once \fBapt-proxy\fP is configured, users then edit their
\fBsources\&.list\fP file to point to the proxy (which uses the http
protocol to serve clients), like so:

.nf
deb http://SERVER:9999/main woody main contrib non-free
deb http://SERVER:9999/non-US woody/non-US main contrib non-free
deb-src http://SERVER:9999/main woody main contrib non-free
deb-src http://SERVER:9999/non-US woody/non-US main contrib non-free

deb http://SERVER:9999/helixcode/ woody main
.fi

What path should be specified after the server name and port number
depends on the configuration of \fBapt-proxy\fP (which can restrict
paths and send different paths to different servers)\&.  In this
example, non-US/ and helixcode/ actually retrieve files from different
back-end servers\&.

Note that you can also use the nicknames `unstable', `frozen' etc, but
they will be slightly slower for `apt-get update'.
.PP
.SH "SERVER CONFIGURATION"
See
.BR apt-proxy.conf (8)
for details of how to set up apt-proxy to use backends near to you.
.PP
.SH "SYMLINKS AND DIRECTORIES"

\fBapt-proxy\fP will copy symbolic links from the server, but it will
never update them while they are still linked to a real file.  For
most users, this will not matter.  The exception is that every time a
Packages or Packages.gz file is served from a path which contains a
directory, the back-end servers are probed to see if the symbolic link
has changed (eg. `unstable/').  This is why it is slightly faster to
use the real distribution names (eg. `woody/') in your
\fBsources.list\fP.

Directories are also created on demand, where they exist on the
backend server.

.PP
.SH "CARE AND FEEDING OF MIRRORS"

\fBapt-proxy\fP reduces the bandwidth requirements of Debian mirrors
by synchronizing uncompressed Packages files where possible (much
cheaper than downloading the entire compressed file), by restricting
the frequency of Packages, Releases and Sources file updates from the
back end, by keeping partial transfers, and only doing a single rsync
for any file, how ever many users request it from the proxy.

.SH "BUGS"
It does not support http front ends, so apt-proxies cannot be chained.

apt-get(8) does not like HTTP headers without a Content-Length:,
making streaming cumbersome.

Packages are not compressed using gzip --rsyncable, which gives a 30%
reduction in bytes transferred for binary packages, and much greater for
source and other packages.

.SH "AUTHOR"
