Description: Debian archive proxy and partial mirror builder
 apt-proxy automatically builds a Debian HTTP mirror based
 on requests which pass through the proxy.  It's great for
 multiple Debian machines on the same network with a slower
 internet link.
 .
 The archive is automatically kept up to date using http,
 ftp or rsync.  Cache cleaning of unused and old versions 
 is also configurable.  You can also import the contents of 
 your apt cache into the archive using apt-proxy-import.
 .
