apt-proxy (1.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add updated README to .deb, thanks to Thorsten Gunkel for pointing
    this out and other suggestions.
  * Changed main archive name from debian to main in apt-proxy.conf to make it
    less confusing.
  * Documented RSYNC_TIMEOUT in apt-proxy.conf manpage.
  * Minor changes to apt-proxy manpage.  The manpages will get a proper
    overhaul once the installation has been modified to create the user and
    cache directories.
  * Add a couple more rsync servers to default apt-proxy.conf
  * Add debian/TODO

apt-proxy (1.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainter - thanks to Andrew McMillan for sponsoring.
    (closes: #123499)
  * New upstream release (closes: #112029)
     - Some bug fixes, bashism cleanups
     - Upstream has been inactive for 6 months now.  I have not had
       any contact since September.
  * Add Depends: grep-dctrl
    (closes: #76113, #78256, #114855, #99976, #121456)
  * Remove unneeded procmail dependency (closes: #76634, #116188)
  * No longer depend on bash.
  * Depend on netbase for update-inetd (closes: #75993)
  * Remove Recommends:ftp-server
  * Merged in Stephen Rothwell's changes
     - Use tail and stat if available, which is faster
  * Supply a working apt-proxy.conf (part of bug #96517).  Set the top level
    cache directory to /var/cache/apt-proxy and supply it as part of the
    package.  To get this package running now, you only need to create the
    user and logfile and enable the service in inetd.  I'll fix these in a
    future release.
  * Made improvements to the script:
     - Fix keep-alive handling: If apt-proxy knows the file size, the
       connection is kept open, otherwise it is closed. Also, fix hangs in
       certain situations by improving locking and only keep the connection
       alive if asked by the client. (closes: #96517, #80839,
       #99927, #99948)
     - Add rsync timeout support in config file (RSYNC_TIMEOUT parameter)
     - Create cache second level directory if it does not exist
     - Rework file locking
     - Improve debug logging to help investigate remaining problems.
  * Fix typo in apt-proxy.8, thanks to Uwe Hermann (closes: #116234)
  * Updated Standards-Version (no changes were necessary)
  * README: Added instructions for creating apt-proxy.conf and outline the
    steps needed to get apt-proxy working.
