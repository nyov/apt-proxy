  * Make it possible to install on Potato again by removing --diabled-login
    and --shell from adduser invocation.  They are on by default for a system
    user anyway. (Sourceforge bug #516318)
  * Add note to README about usage on Potato
  * Make Debian native

apt-proxy (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - New config file paramter, MAX_VERSIONS, to limit the number of package
      versions to keep in the cache directory.  Thanks to Martin Schwenke.
    - New parameters for apt-proxy for runtime setting of config file and log
      file locations.  Thanks to Gerhard Muntingh. (closes: #77929)
    - Use the package filelists logic from Martin Schwenke to send the size of
      package files before downloading, meaning connection keep-alive logic can
      be used.
    - Fix the problem of files being corrupted during streaming (often seen as
      a MD5 sum error which would go away when the file was requested from
      apt-proxy again), by switching back to using dd instead of tail.
    - Check for corrupted .deb and .gz files in the cache before sending
      them to the client. (closes: #132493)
    - Bye bye .diff: The Sourceforge project is now up to date and includes the
      debian packaging.
  * Really rename main archive name, not just put it in the changelog
  * Add logrotate script
  * Clean up debian/rules and use DH_COMPAT=3
  * If setting up apt-proxy for the first time, do the following:
    - Create a user, aptproxy (closes: #99259)
    - Add an entry to inetd.conf, without disabling it (closes: #81746)
    - Create a log file owned by the user (closes: #109308)
    This is currently first-install only.  I plan to introduce an upgrade path
    for existing users using debconf when I have time.
  * Move installation instructions that are no longer necessary when using the
    packge into a seperate file, INSTALL.
  * Remove extra manual installation instructions that are no longer necessary
    from README (closes: #132439)
  * Merge remaining information from README about finding rsync servers into
    apt-proxy.conf manpage.
  * Add UK rsync servers to default apt-proxy.conf, thanks to Simon Huggins.

apt-proxy (1.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add updated README to .deb, thanks to Thorsten Gunkel for pointing
    this out and other suggestions.
  * Changed main archive name from debian to main in apt-proxy.conf to make it
    less confusing.
  * Documented RSYNC_TIMEOUT in apt-proxy.conf manpage.
  * Minor changes to apt-proxy manpage.  The manpages will get a proper
    overhaul once the installation has been modified to create the user and
    cache directories.
  * Add a couple more rsync servers to default apt-proxy.conf
  * Add debian/TODO

apt-proxy (1.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainter - thanks to Andrew McMillan for sponsoring.
    (closes: #123499)
  * New upstream release (closes: #112029)
     - Some bug fixes, bashism cleanups
     - Upstream has been inactive for 6 months now.  I have not had
       any contact since September.
  * Add Depends: grep-dctrl
    (closes: #76113, #78256, #114855, #99976, #121456)
  * Remove unneeded procmail dependency (closes: #76634, #116188)
  * No longer depend on bash.
  * Depend on netbase for update-inetd (closes: #75993)
  * Remove Recommends:ftp-server
  * Merged in Stephen Rothwell's changes
     - Use tail and stat if available, which is faster
  * Supply a working apt-proxy.conf (part of bug #96517).  Set the top level
    cache directory to /var/cache/apt-proxy and supply it as part of the
    package.  To get this package running now, you only need to create the
    user and logfile and enable the service in inetd.  I'll fix these in a
    future release.
  * Made improvements to the script:
     - Fix keep-alive handling: If apt-proxy knows the file size, the
       connection is kept open, otherwise it is closed. Also, fix hangs in
       certain situations by improving locking and only keep the connection
       alive if asked by the client. (closes: #96517, #80839,
       #99927, #99948)
     - Add rsync timeout support in config file (RSYNC_TIMEOUT parameter)
     - Create cache second level directory if it does not exist
     - Rework file locking
     - Improve debug logging to help investigate remaining problems.
  * Fix typo in apt-proxy.8, thanks to Uwe Hermann (closes: #116234)
  * Updated Standards-Version (no changes were necessary)
  * README: Added instructions for creating apt-proxy.conf and outline the
    steps needed to get apt-proxy working.
