TODO list for apt-proxy

- Change default user to apt-proxy.  Add debconf questions for username and
  port number.  Create the user, enable the service in inetd, create the log
  file and change ownership to the apt-proxy user.

- Bzzt... contact established with upstream.  They are active and have sent an
  update including cache cleaing that uses the Packages files to remove
  versions that are no longer in the archives.  I have integrated it into my
  local copy and will release in a few days if no problems arise.

- Add more possible servers to default config file.  I would be grateful if
  people who are using alternative servers would file a wishlist bug containing
  their apt-proxy.conf, and I'll integrate it into the distribution.

- Work through the remaining bugs in the BTS.  Keep those reports coming in folks!
