TODO list for apt-proxy

- Return a better error message if the backend servers do not exist, rather
  than 'directory does not exist'

- Make it more clear that apt-proxy should not be configured as an http proxy,
  but as an http server, or support using apt-proxy as a proxy...

- Add debconf questions for default user and cache directory

- Add more possible servers to default config file.  I would be grateful if
  people who are using alternative servers would file a wishlist bug containing
  their apt-proxy.conf, and I'll integrate it into the distribution.

- Work through the remaining wishlist bugs in the BTS.  Keep those reports
  coming in folks!

- Rewrite in perl.  Join the apt-proxy-user list or #apt-proxy on IRC if you
  want to be involved!
