_Description: Upgrading from pre-v1.9 packages.
 You seem to be upgrading from a version of apt-proxy previous to v1.9.
 .
 apt-proxy has been rewritten in python and the new configuration file
 format is incompatible with previous version. Hopefully you will like the
 new format better :)
 .
 I will build /etc/apt-proxy/apt-proxy-v2.conf based on your old settings
 if you did't already have such file. In any case, a backup file will be
 written to /etc/apt-proxy/apt-proxy-v2.conf.backup
 .
 There are also other issues documented in
 /usr/share/doc/apt-proxy/UPGRADING

_Description: Upgrading issues
 The upgrading script dumped some warnings and they have been mailed to
 root@localhost.
 .
 You should read those warnings and /usr/share/doc/apt-proxy/UPGRADING and
 revise your configuration (/etc/apt-proxy/apt-proxy-v2.conf)
