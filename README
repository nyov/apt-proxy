This is part of the Debian GNU/Linux package for apt-proxy.

If you have installed apt-proxy using the Debian package, you now need to
do the following:

1. Edit apt-proxy.conf to select the nearest backend servers for you.  See
   the apt-proxy.conf(5) manpage for details.
2. Point your apt clients to the proxy.  See the apt-proxy(8) manpage for
   details.

If you are installing from scratch, for example on a non-Debian machine, have
a look at INSTALL for manual installation instructions.
