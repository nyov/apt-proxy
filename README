                 	apt-proxy README

              Chris Halls <chris.halls@gmx.de>

This is part of the Debian GNU/Linux package for apt-proxy.

If you have installed apt-proxy using the Debian package, you now need to
do the following:

1. Edit apt-proxy.conf to select the nearest backend servers for you.  See
   the apt-proxy.conf(5) manpage for details.
2. Point your apt clients to the proxy.  See the apt-proxy(8) manpage for
   details.
3. run apt-get update on a client, to initialise the archive directories and
   filelists.
4. If you have an apt cache directory full of .debs, you can use
   apt-proxy-import(8) to copy them into the apt-proxy archive.

If you are installing from the source tar.gz, for example on a non-Debian
machine, have a look at INSTALL for manual installation instructions.

Using apt-proxy with Debian Potato
----------------------------------
Since I modified the build scripts to use debhelper 3, it is no longer to build
this package on Potato.  However, you can still install and use a package that
has been built on a Woody system, or downloaded from the Woody archives.
(Thanks to Thorsten Gunkel for testing this and other aspects of the package.)
