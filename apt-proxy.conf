### Rsync Backends
# Three or more fields each:
# 1) URL prefix
# 2) Dir to put files in (remember the trailing /!)
# 3...) rsync backends to replace it with (remember the trailing /!)

# You can specify multiple backends like this:
#add_backend /main/					\
#	$APT_PROXY_CACHE/debian/			\
#	SERVERONE::debian/				\
#	SERVERTWO::debian/				\
#	SERVERTHREE::debian/

# HINT: Any request matching none of these is not served, making
# partial caching easy.
