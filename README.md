Notice
------

*apt-proxy* (Python) development has been on hold for very long,
and it's no longer packaged in current debian.

Alternatives (for debian mirror caching proxies) are:
* approx (OCaml)
* apt-cacher (Perl+Webserver)
* apt-cacher-ng (C)

For actual mirroring (even partial) there are many more
* apt-mirror
* archvsync (debian's inhouse mirror scripts)
* (reprepro)
* ...


See README for information about *apt-proxy*.
